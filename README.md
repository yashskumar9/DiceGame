## Game Rules
- Players take turns rolling a dice.
- If a player rolls a `1`, their turn ends, and they lose any accumulated points for that round.
- Players can choose to **hold** their score, which adds their current round points to their total score and switches the turn to the next player.
- The first player to reach **100 points** wins the game.
- A **New Game** button allows players to reset the game at any time.

## How to Play
1. Click **Roll Dice** to roll the dice and accumulate points.
2. Click **Hold** to save your points and pass the turn.
3. The first player to score 100 points wins the game.
4. Click **New Game** to restart the game anytime.

Enjoy playing the dice game and challenge your friends to see who reaches 100 points first!
